# Performing theme updates

Instructions for updating this theme.
1. Make changes to this theme locally.
2. Preview changes using `bundle exec jekyll serve`
3. If necessary build the gemspec file using: `gem build intersect-training-theme.gemspec`. This does auto-version but should really control releases through GitHub.
4. Commit and push the changes to github
5. Update any downstream repositories using this theme by pushing empty commits to force a site rebuild.
