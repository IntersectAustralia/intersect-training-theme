# Instructor notes

If you have documents that you don't want to be publicly available you can use the following in the YAML frontmatter.

```
published: false
```

There is no need to put use a layout etc in this `.md` file because it will not be rendered.

If you are using publishing this through GitHub pages you can still let people know it's there through a link to the repository location, like [this](#)
