Now let's have a look at some images. By default, all images will show with a thin border, will be centered and have max width scaled to 100% of the available space. This means both small and large images will appear the same size. For example...

## Small image
This is a 557 x 370 pixel image.

![A small image]({{ site.baseurl }}/modules_assets/small_image.jpg)


## Big image
This is a 6000 x 4000 pixel image.

![A big image]({{ site.baseurl }}/modules_assets/big_image.jpg)
