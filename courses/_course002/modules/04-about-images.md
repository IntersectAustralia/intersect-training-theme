Now let's have a look at some images. By default, all images will show with a thin border, will be centered and have max width scaled to 100% of the available space. This means both small and large images will appear the same size.

In markdown, images are added in a similar way to URLs, except that they are preceeded with `!`

For example...

## Small image
This is a 557 x 370 pixel image.

```
![A small image](../assets/small_image.jpg)
```

![A small image](../assets/small_image.jpg)


## Big image
This is a 6000 x 4000 pixel image.

```
![A big image](../assets/big_image.jpg)
```

![A big image](../assets/big_image.jpg)
