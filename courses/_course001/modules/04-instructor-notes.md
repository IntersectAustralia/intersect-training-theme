If you have documents that you don't want to be publicly available you can use the following in the YAML frontmatter.

```

published: false

```

There is no need to put use a layout etc in this `.md` file because it will not be rendered.

If you are publishing this through GitHub pages you can still let people access it through a link to the location of the file in the repository, like [this](https://github.com/IntersectAustralia/richard_temp/blob/master/_course001/instructor-notes.md).


Congratulations, that's it, you are done with this course. Go back to the [site homepage]({{ site.baseurl }}/) to see more
