This is a course outline template that you can use to build your own course. You will find this file in the `courses/_template` directory of the [GitHub repository]( {{ site.repourl }} ).

Also look at the *collections* part of the `_config.yml` to see how to add this course as a Jekyll collection (which is necessary for rendering these pages).
