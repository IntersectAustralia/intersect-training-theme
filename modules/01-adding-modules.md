# Welcome to module 01

This is a module file. You'll find it in the `/modules/` directory.
To create a new module:
1. Copy this file into the `modules` directory of your repository. Actually you can use whatever folder you like, but `modules` makes a lot of sense for courses.
2. Update the YAML headers at the very top of this file
3. Add your content to the page.
4. Push the changes to github
5. Give yourself a pat on the back

[Go to the next module]({{ site.baseurl }}/modules/02-styling)
